A simple and stupid macroboard. Basically a keyboard but using a custom HID class to perform tasks in the background.
It is based on CircuitPython running on either a RPi2040 or for wireless connection on a SuperMini/ProMini NRF52840 or Nice!Nano. The logic is all implemented in the host software for maximum flexibility.
The current hardware design is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mutenix-org/hardware-macroboard).
