OpenLinkHub is an open-source project that creates virtual USB HID devices on Linux using the `/dev/uinput` interface.
While the project does not include physical USB hardware, it emulates standard USB HID interfaces through the Linux kernel and presence of a physical hardware.
This PID request is for a software-only, open-source implementation intended for non-commercial use.
