This is a port of lua to the Teensy 3.1 setup to inteface with the FastLED library.  Along with that it runs a webserver with a CC3000 wifi adapter allowing the LUA code to be changed at runtime.

The Teensy 3.0 has not enough ram for the project but the amount allocated can be changed if it's being used in other projects.
