*uino-1284p is an Arduino compatible platform based on the ATmega1284P-AU

The *uino-1284p board utilizes the ATmega1284P microcontroller. The main goal of this project is to be able to access more memory, both FLASH and RAM, while keeping the Arduino UNO compatible board size and I/O assignments.

The *uino-1284p uses a ATmega8U4 programmed with USB serial bridge firmware for uploading of scetches and serial console.
