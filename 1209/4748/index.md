The GHETT-IO is a plug-and-play solution for connecting Dance Dance Revolution
dance pads to StepMania.  It's based on the CY8CKIT-059, a $10 board from Cypress
SemiConductor with open schematics.  This board was chosen for it's low cost and
easy availability, enabling the community to build these at home by simply
soldering on a few pin headers.
