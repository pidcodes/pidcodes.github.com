Kleinvoet is a self-contained low-cost passive acoustic monitoring device. The
recorder was initially designed for distributed infrasonic (8Hz) localisation,
and features accurate temporal synchronisation through the use of an onboard
GNSS module. The recorder is capable of 24-bit stereo recording at a variable
sampling rate of 8kHz to 192kHz. The recordings along with timestamp and
operational log information is stored on a microSD card.
