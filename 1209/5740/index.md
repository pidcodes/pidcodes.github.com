The ArduPilot project supports many open source hardware designs. We
don't design the hardware ourselves (we are a software project), but
we work closely with many organisations and companies that do make
open source hardware. For those that don't have their own VID we use a
single VID/PID pair for all boards, then distinguish boards using the
product ID strings in the bootloader and application firmware. 

Schematics for some of the boards we support are here:
