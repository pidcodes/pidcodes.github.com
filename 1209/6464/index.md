This is a completely internal mod for the Nintendo GameCube controller that replaces the stock GameCube connection cord with a USB cord. A custom designed PCB sits inside the controller and houses an ATtiny84 running the micronucleus bootloader and V-USB libraries. It is an HID compliant joystick with reprogrammable LEDs. The project is documented here: <http://www.electricexploits.net/gamecube-controller-usb-conversion-mod/>
