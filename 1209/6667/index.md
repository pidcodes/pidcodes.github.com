Universal Serial aBUSe provides a Keyboard and Mouse, and a "pipe" over which an attacker can transmit arbitrary data. This data is then relayed via a wifi connection to the attacker's Command and Control server.

It is intended to highlight the risks of allowing untrusted USB devices to be connected to your systems.
