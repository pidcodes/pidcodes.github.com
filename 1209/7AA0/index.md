The AIRDOS04 is a semiconductor-based radiation detector, operating on the principle of energy deposition in a semiconductor diode. Equipped with its own batteries and memory storage, the detector is uniquely designed for convenience and efficiency in radiation monitoring in aircraft. Its interchangeable batteries not only power the device but also contain the data storage, streamlining the process of data retrieval and power management. This feature makes AIRDOS04 a highly practical tool for continuous, long-term radiation monitoring in aviation environments.
