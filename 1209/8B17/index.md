USB HID interface for Dendy (NES Famiclone) controller emulation. This project transforms a classic Dendy/Famicom gamepad into a modern USB HID device using an STM32 BluePill board. Features include support for all standard buttons (D-pad, A/B, Start/Select) plus Turbo A/B functionality with 15Hz rapid fire capability. Perfect for retro gaming enthusiasts who want to use authentic hardware with modern emulators and systems.
