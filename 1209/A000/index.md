A collection of open-source BLE gamepad and controller projects, including research and variations designed for educational robotics, custom input devices, and experimental HID implementations. The firmware is based on ESP32-BLE-Gamepad and NimBLE-Arduino plus other open-source libraries, ensuring efficient BLE communication with minimal resource usage. Hardware designs are tailored for ESP32-based microcontrollers, optimized for low power consumption and reliable connectivity. All associated hardware and firmware are released under permissive open-source licenses, enabling community contributions and modifications. Source code and hardware designs are available at: https://gitlab.com/leet/ble-gamepad-collection.
