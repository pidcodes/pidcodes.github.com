A universal USB bootloader for microcontrollers based on the halfkay protocol

This is just a project to make a simple python programmer be able to load code onto various usb capable microcontrollers.
Within the Global boot firmware directory will be bootloader firmware for various uC's that allow them all to be programmed from the same script.
The Halfkay protocol was made by Paul J Stoffregen for the teensy platform.
