This is simple dumper/writer for Famicom cartridges.

![Dumper](https://github.com/ClusterM/famicom-dumper/raw/master/images/dumper.jpg)

You can use it to:
* Dump cartridges, so you can play copy of your cartridge on emulator
* Read/write battery backed saves, so you can continue your saved game on emulator/console
* Write special cartridges like [COOLGIRL](https://github.com/ClusterM/coolgirl-famicom-multicard)
* Rewrite ultracheap chinese COOLBOY cartridges. Soldering required but it's very simple.
* Test your cartridges
* Some reverse engineering
* Anything else that requires Famicom bus simulation
