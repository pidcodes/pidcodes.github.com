*Inkclip* is a small, approximately square-shaped eInk module. The user updates the pattern displayed on the module via a simple web app using Web MIDI. Its design prioritizes compactness and thus makes it suitable for a range of decoration purposes, *e.g.* as a hair clip, a pin badge, or a fridge magnet.
