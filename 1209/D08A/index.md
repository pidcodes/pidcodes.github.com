This is a programmer for SEGA Megadrive/Genesis and Master System consoles. It is part of MegaWiFi project, but in addition to MegWiFi carts it also supports other carts, like Flatmap64, FrugalMapper, Krikkzz FlashKit, etc. It is based on the CH32V305 RISC-V MCU, and optimized for speed, using a high-speed USB interface.

The hardware requires the [mw-ch32-prog firmware](https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mw-ch32-prog-sch) to work, and must be used with the [mdma-ng client software](https://gitlab.com/doragasu/mdma-ng) on the PC.
