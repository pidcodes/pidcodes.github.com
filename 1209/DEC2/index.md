The WeAct Studio RP2350A_V10 is a compact, high-performance RISC-V development board powered by the Raspberry Pi RP2350 microcontroller. Featuring a dual-core Hazard3-based RISC-V architecture, it offers robust performance for embedded applications. The board includes 520KB of SRAM and 4MB or 16MB of QSPI Flash, providing sufficient memory for complex code execution and storage.

All GPIO pins are fully accessible, supporting various peripherals such as UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, and ADC, making it ideal for prototyping, IoT projects, and RISC-V learning. Measuring just 21mm x 51mm, it is breadboard-friendly and includes 2.54mm pitch pin headers for quick integration and soldering.

The board is open-source, with full hardware files, datasheets, and development resources available on GitHub, offering accessibility for developers, hobbyists, and educators. This makes it an excellent tool for those looking to explore embedded systems and RISC-V architecture.

This PID is used to make this board to work with Circuitpython.
