The Pinscape Controller is software for the Freescale KL25Z microcontroller
board that implements an I/O controller for virtual pinball cabinets.  The
controller provides mechanical analog plunger input sensing (with a couple
of choices of sensor type), key input, accelerometer-based nudge sensing,
and feedback device output control.
