The pico1541 allows you to connect IEC and IEEE-488 Commodore disk drives to modern Windows, Linux and Mac machines using USB.  It provides all of the functionality of an xum1541 adapter and hence supports widely used tools such as OpenCBM, but also offers an enhanced mode, providing additional functionality such as WiFi.  It is based on the Raspberry Pi Pico line of embedded devices.
