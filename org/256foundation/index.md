The 256 Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity based in Nashville, TN that raises money to support open-source developers to build free and open Bitcoin mining software and hardware, we also support education initiatives on the topic through our weekly podcast, [POD256](https://www.pod256.org/) and our monthly [newsletter](https://news.256foundation.org/). Our mission is to dismantle the proprietary mining empire that has stifled innovation and created centralizing forces that jeopardize the attributes that make Bitcoin a powerful freedom technology tool. 100% of donations are passed through to the developers and engineers working on the projects.
