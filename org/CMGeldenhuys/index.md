I'm a PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at
the University of Stellenbosch. My research focusses on wildlife assistive- and
conservation technologies relating to bioacoustics, in particular infrasonic
Elephant rumbles. On the side I like retro tech and film photography.
