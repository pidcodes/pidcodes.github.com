CynaraKrewe is a mixed group of software and electronics engineers who have teamed up to create Cynara.
Members are encouraged to both explore beyond their own discipline(s) and provide guidance to other members were they can. 

Cynara is a microcontroller and FPGA based, modular prototyping solution covering both hardware and software.
The aim of this project is to broaden experience and not only in your own discipline. 
Learning & sharing is what we do. 
In line of this mindset, everything developed within the project will be made available under terms of a permissive (MIT) license.
