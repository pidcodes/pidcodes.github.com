GreenKeys was founded in 2022 as a web media dedicated to keyboards.

Our mission is to introduce products and methods to make your desk environment more comfortable through the human interface device called “keyboard”.

Today, the Internet environment has developed into a part of our daily life infrastructure, and the PCs that use it have also become an essential part of our lives, whether for business or gaming.

On the other hand, most people are not interested in keyboards and other input devices, but are more interested in the main hardware and software components such as operating systems.

Through this web media, we hope to increase interest in input devices and share with our readers the magical power of the keyboard, which is both more efficient and more attractive.
