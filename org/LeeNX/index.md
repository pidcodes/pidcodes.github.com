We run a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) initiative focused on embedded systems, robotics, and low-power wireless communication. Our projects include custom hardware and firmware for BLE gamepads, educational robots, and small-scale autonomous systems. We actively contribute to the open-source community by developing and sharing tools, libraries, and documentation to support others working with ESP32, ARM-based microcontrollers, and cross-compilation workflows.
