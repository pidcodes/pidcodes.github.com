"Nobble" aims to make the interaction between humans and computers more efficient and straightforward. It is a keyboard-like Human Interface Device with user-configurable keys. Each key has an integrated 0.66-inch LCD display that dynamically adjusts to the corresponding function of the key.

This type of workflow optimization is particularly effective for applications such as video editing, 3D design, music production, streaming, programming, and more, as well as everyday tasks like controlling multimedia playback, communication software, and gaming.

The native desktop client allows for the comfortable creation and editing of lists, enabling users to save or load their key mappings for each application without the need to reassign the keys themselves.
