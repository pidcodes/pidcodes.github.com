Badge.Team is a group of volunteers developing electronic conference badges.

We've created the hardware for the [SHA2017](https://sha2017.org), [HackerHotel 2019 & 2020](https://hackerhotel.nl) and [MCH2022](https://mch2022.org) badges
as well as a universal software platform powering not only our own but also a whole list of other conference badges such as the
[Disobey.fi 2019 and 2020](https://disobey.fi/), [CampZone 2019 and 2020](https://campzone.nl/) and [Troopers 2022](https://troopers.de/) badges.

Documentation about our projects can be found on [our website](https://badge.team).
