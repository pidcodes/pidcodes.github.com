I am an aerospace engineer who dabbles in small circuit design for fun.  I create circuits that I find fun and interesting and share them with others who might enjoy then as well.  I can be found on Twitter @bwshockley, and additional details for projects that utilize pid.codes can be found at https://www.minifigboards.com.
