i  : have an an idea
i! : share with the world
!i : allow everyone to modify
ii : and be part of it
```

```
ii is about people
all of us to participlating
with technological inclusion
```

ii should be accessible to anyone as standalone usb gadgets
that can by programmed to customize the target hardware and
OS that the gadget deploys.

An obvious target is an Android phone that can reimage other phones
(and do everything else ii can do).

However the initial target will be a raspberry/banana pi image
that can be used to setup computers and other pi's from scratch via:

* ethernet (pxe)
* wifi (netboot on Apple products).
* usb gadget (emulating a usb keyboard to select boot to disk in bios, with an emulated customized disk)
* usb creation (creating a custom usb disks or sdcards, to replicate more pii images)

We'll jump from there to other platforms, and I'd like for the base to be github.com/ii

iiphone will hopefully be sometime this year
