Pulsar Heavy Industries is an open-source open-hardware modular MIDI controller platform. We're creating a modern platform for people to build MIDI and Audio devices with. This is a non-profit project aimed towards makers wanting to step up their DIY controllers game using modern software and hardware, leveraging manufacturing capabilities that only recently became affordable to the DIY community (such as affordable SMT assembly houses).
