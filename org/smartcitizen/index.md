Smart Citizen empowers communities to better understand their environment. We're a team of passionate people who believe data is critical to inform political participation at all levels. We develop tools for citizen action in environmental monitoring and methodologies for community engagement and co-creation. For the past three years, we have been working on an updated version of the Kit. The new sensors collect urban data more accurately, are easier to use and fully open source. The Smart Citizen 2.0 Kit will be available to order soon!
