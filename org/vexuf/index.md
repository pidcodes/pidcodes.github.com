The VexUF series is a collection of versatile devices designed for a variety of
applications, including data logging, device control, and remote communication
Each device in the series has unique capabilities tailored to different use
cases.

The various VexUF devices -each named after ancient Egyptian gods- series,
currently, includes the "Horus" and "Seth" devices.

The "Horus" device is designed to support both Emergency Operations Centers
(EOCs) and amateur radio operators in monitoring and managing various power
sources and environmental conditions. It is engineered to enhance operational
capabilities by ensuring real-time monitoring of critical parameters, and
immediate response to a set of custom triggers and actuators.

The "Seth" device (Deprecated) was used as a sensor board to communicate with
a Raspberry Pi computer directly to give sensor readings via the serial port.
It was built on a custom Arduino-based board.
